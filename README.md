# SpaceShooter
- Call (game) to start the game
- In this game a stationary player has to shoot a stationary target but there will be a horizontal wind that the player must account for, which changes randomly every time the target is hit (based on Paper Toss, the iPhone game).
- Use left and right arrow keys to rotate player and press <space> to shoot missiles.
